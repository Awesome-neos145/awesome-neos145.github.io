    <h1>XBOX Reset Combination Generator Help</h1>
      <p>To use this generator, you need one of the following:</p>
        <li>Dumped EEPROM from Softmodded XBOX</li>
        <li>Dumped EEPROM from the EEPROM itself</li>
      <p>From the dumped EEPROM, you should have the HDD key. It is in the "xbox info.txt" file that comes with a dumped EEPROM from a Softmodded XBOX.</p>
      <p>If you have an EEPROM.bin, then use the Original XBOX EEPROM Editor.</p>
      <p>Copy and paste the HDD key (not the HDD password) into the textbox in the generator.</p>
      <p>This should spit out a 4 letter code followed by Y. Buttons list as follows:</p>
        <li>Y = Y button</li>
        <li>X = X button</li>
        <li>B = B button</li>
        <li>A = A button</li>
        <li>U = Left Joystick UP</li>
        <li>D = Left Joystick DOWN</li>
        <li>L = Left Joystick LEFT</li>
        <li>R = Left Joystick RIGHT</li>
      <p>This should be all you need to know.</p>
