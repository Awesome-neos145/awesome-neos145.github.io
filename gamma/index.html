  <h1>CHANGELOG 7/21/2024 - v1.1</h1>
  <p>Changed Stonehenge Base's music to the hidden EBB-like underground music. That's all. <a href="https://file.garden/YtxRl-gHkWVkfPs7/psigamma/PSIGAMMA1.1.ips">(Click this link to download v1.1)</a></p>
  <h1>CHANGELOG 7/21/2024 - v1.2</h1>
  <p>Updated sprites. Now, Ness and his friends (except Poo) are always smiling, like it or not. Also modified some battle sprites. <a href="https://file.garden/YtxRl-gHkWVkfPs7/psigamma/PSIGAMMA1.2.ips">Download v1.2</a></p>
  <h1>CHANGELOG 7/21/2024 - v1.3</h1>
  <p>Edited some PSI PP costs. Also decided to change the name of the Magnet PSI. It sounded a bit weird in older versions... <a href="https://file.garden/YtxRl-gHkWVkfPs7/psigamma/PSIGAMMA1.3.ips">Download v1.3</a></p>
  <h1>CHANGELOG 7/27/2024 - v2.0</h1>
  <p>Edited some large bit of the text. Replaced every instance of "Pokey" to "Porky" (i think) and "Giygas" to "Giegue". Overall, big overhaul. (and me learning CCScript) <a href="https://file.garden/YtxRl-gHkWVkfPs7/psigamma/PSIGAMMA2.0.ips">Download v2.0</a></p>
  <h1>CHANGELOG 8/9/2024 - v2.1</h1>
  <p>I've been messing around a lot. I decided to release this now. Paula can now use healing PSI, fixed the game over screen, you can now run, (HOLD Y) and you STILL can't grasp the true form of Giegue's attack. <a href="https://file.garden/YtxRl-gHkWVkfPs7/psigamma/PSIGAMMA2.1.ips">Download v2.1</a></p>
  <h1>CHANGELOG 8/31/2024 - v2.2</h1>
  <p>I messed around a lot, and I edited some things. Ness can use PK Flame, and I finally edited in the 2 window sizes. <a href="https://file.garden/YtxRl-gHkWVkfPs7/psigamma/PSIGAMMA2.2.ips">Download v2.2</a></p>
  <h1>CHANGELOG 10/15/2024 - v2.3 (8th Release of PSI GAMMA)</h1>
  <p>I didn't entirely give up on this romhack just yet. First of all, the Starman Zero has been added to the game. (good luck lmao) Second, a new item was added that lets me drop a certain "talk button" cheat code I've been using in some of my changelog videos. (Please let me know if there are any issues with this build. I haven't been able to playtest the game entirely.) <a href="https://file.garden/YtxRl-gHkWVkfPs7/psigamma/PSIGAMMA2.3.ips">Download v2.3</a></p>
  <h1>CHANGELOG 10/19/2024 - v2.4</h1>
  <p>Patched a game crash after the Starman Zero was defeated. Plus, it now drops that new item once defeated. <a href="https://file.garden/YtxRl-gHkWVkfPs7/psigamma/PSIGAMMA2.4.ips">Download v2.4</a></p>
